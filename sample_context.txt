A target of 10% reduction is set for 2023 with the base line year of 2013. Ventas is working towards meeting this target with energy reduction initiatives and is investigating renewable energy options. We believe that the reason our % achieved is not pro-rata with time elapsed may be due to issues with our base year data. We are investigating this further. Note: The base year emissions are 100% for operations that we still owned in 2017 within our operational control boundary (it excludes emissions from properties that we no longer own).
