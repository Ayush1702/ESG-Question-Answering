The Bridgestone Group is working to achieve its mid-term targets to reduce the volume of CO2 emissions over the entire lifecycle of a tire (15,733kt-CO2 in 2005). Considering the value when CO2 emissions from operations and productsâ€™ after-use are offset by contribution of CO2 reduction at usage stage, the reduction in 2018 was 95% (compared to 2005). We are continuing activities with a dual approach aimed at achieving that contribution to CO2 reduction during use exceeds CO2 emissions from our operations and productsâ€™ after-use by 2020.
