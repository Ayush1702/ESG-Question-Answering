At COP22, on behalf of Schneider Electric, our CEO Jean-Pascal Tricoire signed the Science-based targets initiative aimed at setting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with the global effort to limit warming to 2Â°C. Originally set as a 53% reduction in 2050 vs 2015, we have updated our target to a 60% reduction in 2050 vs 2017 to be in line with our new Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020. This target is an absolute target with a long (2050) and medium term (2035), corresponding to a 2.1% year-on-year emission reduction. The levers of action are three-fold: energy productivity (through our Energy Action ongoing program); use of renewable electricity; and progressive phase-out of SF6 use in products (CO2e from SF6 leaks is c.3% of our total scopes 1 and 2 in 2017). Our scopes 1 and 2 are made of energy consumption and SF6 leaks. As we set 2017 as base year, there is no progress achieved yet.
