To maintain the momentum achieved by our expired goal, Humana set a new emissions reduction target in 2018.  By the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 2.1% YOY decrease (cumulative 10.5%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control.  This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPâ€™s science-based target methodology.  While we exceeded the 2.1 percent YOY reduction in 2018, we plan to keep this target in place through 2022 to improve on this progress.
